# choreBot says go-to do-chores!

This is a simple JS game I coded with the help of Codecademy. It was good practise for using functions in the Dom to manipulate it.\

## Nifty features

The game logic was a challenge but in the end I wrapped my head around it. Notice how you can reset the game using the button at the bottom of the page.

## To be improved

I would do this again in a less structured environment in order to fully think through and understand the game logic involved.
